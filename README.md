Project A : Traffic

Objective:

Dataset:

The NYC Taxi Fare Prediction Dataset provides over 55 million records of taxi trips in New York City from 2009 to 2015. Each record includes essential features like pickup_datetime, pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude, passenger_count, and the target variable, fare_amount. This dataset is valuable for analyzing urban transportation patterns and building machine learning models to predict taxi fares based on spatial-temporal data. The combination of geographic coordinates and time-based features makes it particularly suited for tasks involving spatial and temporal prediction modeling. You can access the dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data).

1. Data Preprocessing

• Load and Clean Data:

o Drop rows with missing values and remove outliers based on unrealistic fare amounts or locations (e.g., fares under $2 or pickup/drop-off points outside New York City).

o Extract features from pickup_datetime, such as hour, day, weekday, and month.

• Feature Engineering:

o Distance Calculation: Calculate the distance between pickup and drop-off locations using the Haversine formula. o Geographical Clustering: Use K-means clustering to cluster the pickup and dropoff locations, assigning each coordinate to a region or cluster.

o Time-based Features: Engineer features like peak hours or rush hours based on time.

• Normalization:

o Normalize or scale numerical features (e.g., distance, latitude, longitude) to improve model convergence.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

• Univariate Analysis:

o Visualize the distribution of target variable (fare_amount) and other key features, such as distance, pickup hour, and day of the week.

• Bivariate Analysis:

o Explore correlations between fare amount and distance, pickup time, and pickup/drop-off locations.

• Geospatial Analysis:

o Plot pickup and drop-off locations on a New York City map to observe hotspot areas for taxi rides and how they relate to fare amounts.

3. Data Visualization

• Heatmaps: o Create heatmaps showing the concentration of pickups and drop-offs across NYC.

• Fare Distribution by Time of Day: o Plot average fare amounts over different times of the day or days of the week.

• Distance vs. Fare Scatter Plot:

o Plot a scatter graph of trip distance against fare to identify the relationship and outliers.

4. Model Building: Neural Network Implementation

• Neural Network Architecture:

o Design a neural network with the following layers:

§ Input layer: Takes in features (distance, pickup and drop-off clusters, day of the week, etc.).

§ Hidden Layers: Include a few dense layers with ReLU activation.

§ Output Layer: Single neuron for regression output predicting fare_amount.

• Training and Validation:

o Split the data into training and validation sets. o Use Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the loss function to train the model.

o Implement early stopping and learning rate scheduling to optimize training.

Hint 1: Be careful for robust preprocessing and tuning of the neural network to avoid overfitting on this dataset.

5. Model Evaluation and Tuning

• Use the test set to evaluate the model’s performance.

• Experiment with hyperparameters (number of layers, learning rate, batch size) to optimize the model.

6. Analysis and Recommendations

1. Spatial-Temporal Analysis: Use geospatial clustering to identify high-density zones for pickups and drop-offs. This can reveal popular areas and times, such as airports, tourist locations, or business districts during rush hours.

2. Peak Demand Analysis: Analyze fare and trip volume distributions across different times of the day and week. High-fare periods could correlate with typical rush hours or weekends.

3. Fare Trends Analysis: Track average fares over different months or years to analyze if there’s seasonality in fare pricing.

Project B : Retail

Objective:

The project’s goal is to replicate a real-world situation in which you study consumer data from e- commerce to create predictive models and extract useful insights. Finding trends in consumer behaviour, maximising marketing initiatives, and guiding corporate plans to improve client retention, boost revenue, and customise marketing strategies are the objectives. You can make use of any open source libraries in python.

Dataset:

The UCI Machine Learning Repository’s Online Retail II dataset is a real-world dataset that includes transactional data from a UK-based online retailer. It records different facets of retail transactions, including item purchases, customer information, and sales dates. This dataset offers a comprehensive understanding of consumer buying patterns and can be used for a variety of analytics, such as product recommendation systems, sales trends, and customer segmentation. The dataset can be found here:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii

Key columns include InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

InvoiceNo is a unique identifier for each transaction, while StockCode and Description provide product-specific information.

Quantity and UnitPrice offer insights into the volume and value of each transaction, allowing for revenue calculations.

CustomerID enables segmentation and customer-based analyses, while Country supports geographical segmentation.

Project Components &amp; Key Insights:

1. Data Cleaning and Exploration:

• Analyse historical data, such as customer demographics, browsing sessions, product views, cart additions, and completed sales, as part of the initial dataset analysis.

• Address missing values, eliminate duplicates, and fix irregularities. To determine the best times to shop, add new options like “Time of Day” and “Day of Week.”

• To uncover significant aspects, use visualisation tools to investigate customer trends, distributions, and correlations.

2. Customer Segmentation

Use clustering techniques (such K-Means or DBSCAN) to divide up your clientele based on their browsing habits, preferences, and purchasing habits.

• Personalised Marketing: Make use of segments to advise tailored promotions (e.g., offering personalised discounts or suggesting products).

• Optimised Communication Times: By examining when each consumer category is most engaged, you can ascertain the ideal times to interact with them.

3. Customer Purchase Prediction:

Using information such as time spent on the website, products viewed, and previous purchases, create a classification model to forecast whether a customer’s browsing session will end in a purchase.

• Conversion-Boosting Strategies: To increase conversions, use forecasts to instantly present special offers or free shipping incentives to prospective customers.

• When to Offer a Discount to Cart Abandoners: Determine the best times and kinds of discounts to entice cart abandoners to finish their purchases.

4. Sales Forecasting:

Use attributes such as goods in a cart, average transaction size, and frequency of purchases to create regression models that predict future sales.

• Seasonal Discount Timing: To ensure steady revenue, pinpoint periods of low sales and recommend well-timed discounts or exclusive deals during offpeak hours.

5. Product Bundling:

Using measures like support, confidence, and lift, use association rule mining (such as the Apriori algorithm) to identify products that are frequently purchased together.

• Product Bundling: Provide discounts for combined items to raise the average order size and recommend product bundles based on consumer purchasing patterns.

• Cross-Promotional Opportunities: Find related items and provide real-time, targeted marketing for customers (e.g., “Customers who bought X also bought Y”).
